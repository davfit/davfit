        <p>Class consciousness, humility and vindication of neighborhood identity. A regeneration of the classic underground adapted and evolved to today's codes. From the south of Madrid,<b> Roberto Osahon (1995) -Ergo Pro-</b>, and <b>Alejandro Fernández (1996), -Ill Pekeño-</b>, came from chaining one precarious job after another, "dishwasher, in clothing stores... whatever" , they both acknowledge shrugging their shoulders and between complicit glances. Now, those from the Madrid neighborhoods of San Cristóbal de Los Ángeles and Orcasitas are considered two of the urban artists with the most projection in Spain.<br><br>Since they were little, they were attracted to everything related to hip-hop culture. Above all that collective support “in the Wu-Tang or Mobb deep style of giving your family a job making music”. In his case, the <b>MG or 'Gregorian Mafia'</b>. Although Ergo Pro already made his songs, he met 'Peke' because he made the videos for him. “One day while recording a video clip, he told me that he also rapped and I asked him to show it to me. He seemed brutal to me and since then we have collaborated on many songs, ”says the rapper, of Nigerian parents.</p></article>

        <article class="col-6 col-s-12 padding"><p class="bold_2">MDA or the young Spanish music in full ecstasy</p><img src="mda.jpg" class="mda" alt="MDA">
          <p>MDA is <b>Marcos de Arriba</b>, he is 23 years old, he was born in Zaragoza and grew up in <b>Ponferrada</b>. In a short time he has become one of the artistic references that combines genres such as trap, hyper-pop and digicore. His latest albums have included <b>“^^ 7 ^” and “Romántico Salvaj3”</b>, two albums that consolidate him as one of the new names on the emerging scene to follow.<br><br>10 years ago he recorded his first song thanks to <b>Hugo, his older brother</b>, since he rapped and opened the doors of this world for him since it was very difficult to record with those, things were different. I was always far from him, so whenever I went to see him in <b>Zaragoza</b>, his brother managed so that Marcos could record a song. He has been writing songs since third grade, and as a child he was always very cool because he wanted to be like those French and American rappers that his father listened to. Going back even further in the past, when he barely knew how to stand up, he would climb the stairs of the houses of his town to sing for the countrymen as if it were a stage. So he's been <b>in music since he was literally born.</b></p>

        <article class="col-4 col-s-12"><h2 class="Hoke">Hoke:The Valencian star</h2><img src="Hoke.jpg" class="hoke_img" alt="Hoke"></article>
        <article class="col-8 col-s-12"><br><br><br><p>There is a singer in Spain who does not need record companies or promoters to rub shoulders with Rosalía, C. Tangana or Bad Bunny at the <b>top of sales</b>. What's more, he doesn't even need to spend a euro on advertising for tens of thousands of teenagers and twenty-somethings to found his songs on Spotify and YouTube or to crash the websites that sell tickets to his concerts. Your name? No one knows, but he calls himself Hoke and has just released <b>the album 'BBO'</b> with producer <b>Louis Amoeba</b>. "I've been stuck without a godfather", celebrates the Valencian on the album, already converted (except for surprise) into the hit of the year.</p>
          <p>The phenomenon of <b>'BBO'</b>, yes, could be seen coming, although it was difficult to measure the magnitude. The singer's followers had been eager for just over a year to receive the album. In fact, the songs that he performed in concerts circulated on YouTube and the fans knew them inside out. In Madrid, for example, the shouting was deafening and there were rhymes that were celebrated as if he had hit a three-pointer from midfield (for example, minute 14:03 in the video below). The one who writes this was there and it was impossible not to realize that he was cooking something out of the ordinary.</p>
         <p>Even with those, <b>Hoke and Amoeba</b> have broken all the expected molds for a self-released debut album. In their first 24 hours, they reached <b>855,629 plays on Spotify</b>. That figure may not tell you anything, but the context does: it is the third <b>best premiere of a Spanish album of the year</b>. In fact, all the songs entered the 200 most listened to day. It is not that it was a week with little news for lovers of the genre. Natos and Waor, the most successful Spanish rappers of the last decade (and perhaps in history), released their album the same week and reached fifth place on the sales list, while <b>the Valencian duo came in fourth</b>. It is a 'ranking' in which both physical sales and listening to 'streaming' accumulate, although in that 'top 5' they were the only ones along with Feid who had not released a physical format.</p>

        <article class="col-7 col-s-12"> <h2>The latest releases of Cruz Cafuné</h2><p>Cruzzi's new releases, and mainly his next full-length work, are based on a work process that has evolved compared to the beginning of his career years ago, as he explains: “I used to make music when I felt I had to. , for desire and inspiration. Now I try to do it out of habit, sit every day, even a little. And it's frustrating, because magic doesn't always happen when you get to the studio and many times you get discouraged because you didn't do anything. Before I made music when I needed it, I sat down and left. Now it's more of a shovel pick… it's more frustrating, but the results are better”.</p><p>Carlos also says that he is seldom alone in this process, and it is that -as he also expresses in his songs- his circle is vital for him and it is also vital in his artistic development. “The good thing about music is traveling, eating and meeting people. Doing it with your friends and with the rock that shares that passion with you is even better”, he declares. “Whenever I am in a session and there is someone else, they will add. So, in that sense, I see being in Madrid as an addition rather than an impediment. In Madrid I record and Tenerife I use it to be calm, be with my family and make music. In fact, all the records I like in the booklet say 'recorded in Hawaii, Los Angeles and London'. And I, well, Tenerife and Madrid, which is two hours away by plane, so…”, he comments with a laugh.</p></article>
